This is the first try at converting my old Dokuwiki site to Jekyll and github
pages. I have mainly used the old site for installation documentation and my old
consultant CV.

Luckily someone made a Dokuwiki to Markdown converter doing most of the heavy
lifting, you find it [here](https://github.com/ludoza/DokuWiki-to-Markdown-Converter).

``` bash
php convert.php input.txt # will produce a input.md in same folder
```
