#Linux FScrypt

## Initial setup
First define the device in question, usually something like `/dev/sda1`
```bash
$ export DEVICE=/dev/sda1
```

To setup a filesystem to support encryption, first check that your block size is equal to your page size by comparing the outputs of `getconf PAGE_SIZE` and `tune2fs -l /dev/device | grep 'Block size'`. If these are not the same, DO NOT ENABLE ENCRYPTION.

```bash
$ getconf PAGE_SIZE
4096
```
```bash
$ sudo tune2fs -l $DEVICE | grep 'Block size'
Block size:               4096
```
As the values are the same we can proceed. Now enable encryption on the EXT4 device:


```bash
$ tune2fs -O encrypt $DEVICE
```

Now we need to install some fscrypt

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install fscrypt libpam-fscrypt
```

## Set up PAM
Create the file `/usr/share/pam-configs/keyinit-fix` (need sudo rights) and fill with the following
```text
Name: keyinit fix
Default: yes
Priority: 0
Session-Type: Additional
Session:
	optional	pam_keyinit.so force revoke
```

Next re-configure pam to use fscrypt
```
$ sudo pam-auth-update
```
Now log out of the session and in again to load the new pam files.

## Encrypt a local folder

Start the initial setup:
```
$ sudo fscrypt setup
Replace "/etc/fscrypt.conf"? [y/N] y
Customizing passphrase hashing difficulty for this system...
Created global config file at "/etc/fscrypt.conf".
```
The setup encryption on the root partition
```
$ sudo fscrypt setup /
```
Finally encrypt a test folder
```
$ mkdir encrypted
$ fscrypt encrypt /encrypted # Select 1 - Your login passphrase (pam_passphrase)
```
Logout and login to see that the folder gets decrypted without having to type a password. It is transparent to the yourself, but other user will see files with random names and encrypted content. 

## Encrypt the home partitition
Do this as in a TTY terminal (i.e. `CTRL-ALT 1`) as root or another user as your system might act strange if your are graphically logged in while doing this. 

```bash
$ export USERNAME=user1
$ sudo su -
$ mv /home/$USERNAME /home/$USERNAME.bak
$ mkdir /home/$USERNAME
$ fscrypt encrypt /home/$USERNAME --user=$USERNAME
$ rsync -avH --info=progress2 --info=name0 /home/$USERNAME.bak /home/$USERNAME
$ rm -rf /home/$USERNAME.bak
```
The strange options for the rsync is just to provide a more easy readable progress when there are several hundred thousand files.
