**WORK IN PROGRESS**

# Culture

Management job is to set the culture:

* Secure openness and cooperation
* Minimize time waste
    * Is everyone getting 100% out of this meeting or would it be better to take this in a smaller group?
    * Could this meeting have been a email instead?
* Ensure nobody holds back innovation or gets stuck either in ways of working or in a technology stack
* Ensure people are always learning and feel challenged
* Ensure people are qualified and that proper vetting has been done before hiring
* Fire people who actively work against the culture, can't take responsibility or are not qualified to do their job
* Resist stupid decisions from their management, fx. outsourcing, corporate standardization on bad tools, estimates that nobody uses etc.

## Things to strive for

* Small teams
* Responsibility and decision-making competence should be in the bottom of the organization hierarchy
    * Managements job is to help execute on decisions not make them
* Technical skilled people that can cover more roles and take responsibility are the types you want to hire
    * Rather get one person for twice the money than two for half, that neither can or will take responsibility
* Fixers/project secretary instead of "manager/coach/etc"
    * Not all tasks in a team are technical and especially in big organization the team might have jobs where having someone with a "pushy" personality that don't take no for an answer would be a better fitter than a highly skilled technical introvert. 

## Things to avoid

* Management and formal structure
    * Works against the people who do the work taking responsibility and having decision-making competence
* More people as it requires more formal structure
* Focus on process and people who only focus on process
* Project/SCRUM/Agile/"insert your process framework here" Manager, Masters, Leaders, Coaches as a full time job
* The team might opt to use a project management framework, but if they are spending more than 5-10% of their time/budget on process management something is wrong, this means this type of role can never be a full time
* Bonuses and promotions
    * Makes people focus on formal structure instead of creating value
* People who only work with formal structure (process people, managers, etc.)
    * They use organizational energy on enforcing or gaming formal structure and remove decisions power from the bottom
* Single skilled people
    * It requires more people to cover all roles

# Teams

## Team size

The optimal team size is as small as possible, so always try to get people that can cover more than one role. 

The reason we want to have small team sizes is to avoid exponential growing communication overhead. Humans are social beings and we invest time and energy in the people we work with, the larger team size the more time we spend on maintaining relationships and talking to each other. While using time to understand other people is good, the total time for this grows exponentially with the team size. Meaning at some point a large enough team will spend most of it's time communicating and little to no time working.

## Qualifications

In an optimal team all members of the team can do all tasks equally well. This almost never happens as we are limited by the experience and qualification people come with. Also people will have preferences for what they like to work on, even though most developers today say they are full-stack, they often have more experience and/or preference for working on backend, frontend, styling, etc. So with this in mind it might be better to focus on make sure all team members at least would have the ability to do or understand each others job.

## Roles

Roles are not "people" but a another word for responsibilities and tasks a team has in building a product, the main point of them is ensure we work efficiently and that all the areas are covered and get the needed focus. It's better if people grow into the roles organically because they are the best at them or they can't live without them being done. 

All roles related to project management should be shared and go on turn, fx. scrum master role could change on a weekly basis, this ensures that the team will agree on a reasonable level structure and project management overhead and that everybody understands and support the person that has that role for a give week.

The reason this important is because most people want to do their best, so if you are on a team where you are a support function to the people doing the work such as scrummaster/project manger/agile coach/business process etc. And you don't have enough work you will tend to invent things to do to keep yourself busy, fx introducing a ticket system and setting up a long a tedious workflow, using hours a week on standups, planning sessions, retrospectives etc.

## Team examples

### WebApp product team with integration

* 3-5 x developers (1 with tech lead potential)
    * 1 x styler
    * 1-2 x fullstack frontender
    * 1-2 x fullstack backender/devops (C#/NodeJS/Go)
* 1-2 x UI/UX
* 1 x project owner (Shared or covers more roles)
* 1 x project fixer (Shared or covers more roles)
* 1 x shared tester (Shared or covers more roles)
